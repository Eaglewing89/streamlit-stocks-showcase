# Backend Implementation

The backend of the Streamlit Stocks Showcase is responsible for fetching financial data, performing technical analysis, and integrating with the OpenAI API to generate market commentary.

## Core Components

Located in the `src/` directory, the backend is structured into several modules:

*   **`config.py`**: Manages configuration settings for the application, such as API keys and data sources.
*   **`dashboard.py`**: (If applicable, otherwise remove or adjust) Orchestrates the main backend logic, coordinating data flow between different modules.

*   **`ai/`**: Handles interactions with the OpenAI API.
    *   `commentary_generator.py`: Contains the logic for generating prompts and sending requests to the OpenAI API to produce market commentary based on the analyzed stock data.

*   **`analysis/`**: Performs calculations for technical indicators.
    *   `technical_calculator.py`: Includes functions to compute various technical indicators like Moving Averages, Standard Deviation, RSI, etc., based on the historical stock data.

*   **`cache/`**: Implements caching mechanisms to improve performance.
    *   `simple_cache.py`: Provides a basic caching solution to store and retrieve frequently accessed data, such as historical stock prices, reducing redundant API calls or computations.

*   **`data/`**: Manages data fetching and storage.
    *   `yfinance_provider.py`: Contains the logic to fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

## Data Flow

1.  The application (via the frontend) requests data for a specific stock and time period.
2.  The `yfinance_provider` fetches the raw historical stock data.
3.  This data can be cached by `simple_cache` to speed up subsequent requests.
4.  The `technical_calculator` processes the raw data to compute selected technical indicators.
5.  The processed data and indicators are then passed to the `commentary_generator`.
6.  The `commentary_generator` constructs a prompt and queries the OpenAI API.
7.  The AI-generated commentary, along with the stock data and indicators, is returned to the frontend for display.

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented throughout the backend to manage issues such as API request failures, data processing errors, or invalid user inputs. This ensures the application remains robust and provides informative feedback to the user when problems occur.
